# Cetiris
"Four" in croatian

Modern guideline Tetris ported to the web! <br>
Implemented without `<canvas>`, animated only with `CSS` transitions! <br>
Integrated with the [Quaternion](https://github.com/shine00chang/quaternion) Tetris bot (also by me), try playing against it in `Bot` mode!<br>

Try it out on Vercel [here](https://cetiris.vercel.app/)
